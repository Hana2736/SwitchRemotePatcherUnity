# [Download](https://github.com/EwanMac3/SwitchRemotePatcherUnity/releases/latest)

**!! Requires sys-botbase, download it [here.](https://github.com/olliz0r/sys-botbase/releases/latest)**

**!! Use this only on banned consoles or a properly isolated emuMMC! There is a high chance of getting banned if you use this in Splatoon 3!**



A basic tool to control IPS-style patches on the Nintendo Switch remotely. You can toggle and change patches while the game is running, making testing super easy.

Works great with Splatoon 3 and patches from Coxxs at [this link](https://github.com/Coxxs/public-pchtxt/)

**Setup:**
- Install sys-botbase to the console (and reboot)
- Edit the ipAddr.txt file to the IP address of your console

**Usage:**
- Run the program, wait for it to connect, and open the game
- Add patches by entering or pasting them into the editor on the right, then save them
- Toggle patches on/off with the on/off toggle on the left. If you update the game, you need to delete the patches and add them again with the updated code, otherwise they will break.
- "On by default" will turn the selected patch on as soon as the menu connects (or when the game boots)
